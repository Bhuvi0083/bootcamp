/**
 * Create a Java class named Vehicle with attributes make, model, year, and price,
 * along with a method displayDetails() to print these attributes.
 *
 * Derive subclasses Car, Motorcycle, and Truck from Vehicle,
 * adding specific attributes and overriding the displayDetails() method to include the new attributes.
 *
 * Write a Java program that demonstrates the use of these classes by creating instances of each subclass,
 * setting their attributes, and calling displayDetails() to print out the details of each vehicle.
