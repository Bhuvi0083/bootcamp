/**
 * Write a Java class named LRUCache that implements the Least Recently Used (LRU) caching algorithm.
 * Your class should support two operations: get(int key) and put(int key, int value). The get(key) method should return the value associated with the given key if the key exists in the cache, or -1 if the key does not exist. The put(key, value) method should insert or update the value associated with the given key. If the cache reaches its capacity, it should evict the least recently used item before inserting the new item.
 *
 * Your implementation should use appropriate data structures to achieve the desired time complexity for both get and put operations. You can assume that keys and values are non-negative integers.
 *
 * Please provide the Java class implementation for the LRUCache class with the specified functionalities.
