# Main Features
1.      Statically typed language:

        Type checking performed at compile time

2.     Object Oriented:

       Everything in Java is an object.

3.     Multi-threaded:
      
       We can write Java programs that with manu tasks at once by defining multiple threads

# Basic Syntax

    <access_modifier> <return_type> <method_name>(list_of_parameters) {
      // body
    }
### Access Modifiers

    public: It is accessible in all classes in your application.
    protected: It is accessible within the class in which it is defined and in its subclass/es
    private: It is accessible only within the class in which it is defined.
    default: It is declared/defined without using any modifier. It is accessible within the same class and package within which its class is defined.
### Return type

    The data type of the value returned by the method or void if does not return a value. It is Mandatory in syntax.
### Parameter list
    Comma-separated list of the input parameters is defined, preceded by their data type,
### Example
    public int max(int x, int y) {
      if (x > y) return x; else return y
    }

## Arrays

## Linked Lists
    Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at 
    a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.

## Stack
    The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).
    In stack, all insertion and deletion are permitted at only one end of the list.

## Queue
    The order is First In First Out (FIFO).

## Hashing
     special function called the Hash function which is used to map a given value with a particular key for 
     faster access of elements.

## Multi-tasking
    Multitasking can be achieved in two ways:
    1. Process-based Multitasking (Multiprocessing)
    2. Thread-based Multitasking (Multithreading)
